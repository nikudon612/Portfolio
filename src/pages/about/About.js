          Full-Stack Software Developer with a background in Photography. My 10
          years as a Photographer provide me with a unique set of skills -
          ability to collaborate, multi-tasking, creativity, being customer
          service minded, and a design oriented eye. I implement these skills
          everyday to help me become a better developer.
          <br />
          <br />I am also a freelance photographer based in Queens, NY. I have
          shot for several publications, online magazines, and my work has been
          shown in galleries in the US and abroad. I have a huge love for the
          analogue photography process. In my freetime, I enjoy spending time in
          my city and in nature, playing video games, reading manga, and when
          the swell is good - surfing at Rockaway Beach in Queens.
